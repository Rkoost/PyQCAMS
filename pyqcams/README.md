The main program named `qct.py` contains the main classes for calculations. The `utils.py` file contains helper functions, and `constants.py` contains the relevant constants. The `plotters.py` contains modules to plot trajectories, energies, and 3D visualizations. `analysis.py` contains analysis functions to calculate opacity, cross section, and rate coefficients. The results of the analysis functions are indexed by `R, Q, and Diss` representing reaction, quenching, and dissociation products, respectively.
