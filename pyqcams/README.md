The main program named `pymar.py` contains the main classes for calculations. The `utils.py` file contains helper functions, and `constants.py` contains the relevant constants. The `plotters.py` contains modules to plot trajectories, energies, and 3D visualizations. Use `psave.py` to run trajectories in parallel and save to csv.
