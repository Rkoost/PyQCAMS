# Example (H<sub>2</sub> + Ca) 
<p>A typical PyQCAMS simulation folder for the reaction H<sub>2</sub> + Ca. The <code>inputs.py</code> file contains all of the input information and defines the input dictionary. The input dictionary is then used to run some trajectories in the same file using the <code>runN()</code> function.  Numerical potentials <code>h2_pec.dat</code> and <code>cah_au.txt</code> are in atomic units. There are both short (<code>results/sample/sampleshort.txt</code>) and long (<code>results/sample/samplelong.txt</code>) sample outputs of the results.</p>

<p>The <code>CaH2_study.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook is a tutorial notebook to guide the user through the steps and attributes of the PyQCAMS program, using the H<sub>2</sub> + Ca reaction as an example. We demonstrate how to use the <code>analysis</code> library to produce opacity, cross section, and rate coefficient results. We use data previously calculated as an opacity function in <code>results/opacity.txt</code>, generated from data available at https://figshare.com/s/8b923dab304005ae7a5c.</p>
